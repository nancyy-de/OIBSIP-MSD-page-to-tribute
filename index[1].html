      <h2>Why I Admire M.S. Dhoni</h2>
      <p>
        Mahendra Singh Dhoni, fondly known as "MSD", is not just a cricketer — he is an inspiration. His calm demeanor, razor-sharp mind, and humble nature have made him one of the most respected figures in the sports world.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I adore most about Dhoni is his composure under pressure. Whether it’s the last over of a World Cup final or a crucial decision behind the stumps, Dhoni’s presence always exudes calmness. He has led India to numerous historic victories, including the ICC T20 World Cup 2007, ICC ODI World Cup 2011, and ICC Champions Trophy 2013.
      </p>
      <p>
        Off the field, his simplicity and quiet lifestyle reflect his grounded personality. Despite being a global icon, he remains deeply connected to his roots in Ranchi. His love for the Indian Army and humility towards fans shows his true character.
      </p>
      <p>
        MSD teaches us the importance of patience, leadership, and staying humble no matter how high we rise. He will always remain my role model.
